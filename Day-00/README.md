# Day 00 of SwiftUI - How to become an IOS developer 

7 things...
1. Core skills 
2. Extension skills
3. Common mistakes
4. Learning resources
5. Connecting to the community
6. How long it will take to reach my goals
7. Preparing for the first job

## 1. Core Skills
1. Swift 
2. SwiftUI
3. Working with Data
4. Networking 
5. Version Control

### 1.1 Swift
- Swift is a programming language created by Apple.
- Swift is relatively new compared to older programming languages like Java and Pythin
- Swift has a lot of new features that may be challenging to learn 

### 1.2 SwiftUI
- SwiftUI is a framework from Apple for writing apps for MacOs, iOS, watchOS, iPadOs, etc using Swift language
- SwiftUI is new. Apple had an older framework called UIKit for app development
- SwiftUI is significantly easier than UIKit
- SwiftUI was built for Swift
- UIKit was built for Apple's older language - Objective C
- SwiftUI works on Apple's all platforms
- SwiftUI is the future

### 1.3 Working with Data & 1.4 Networking
We should at least how to fetch JSON from remote servers and display it in an app

### 1.5 Version Control
- Knows at least to store the code somewhere safe

## 2. Extension skills
1. UIKit
2. Core Data
3. Testing
4. Software Architecture
5. Multithreading

## 2.1 UIKit
### 2.1.1 Why UIKit?
- It's popular
- It's more powerful than SwiftUI as of 2021
- We can create precise layout
- More solution in UIKit than SwiftUI

### 2.1.2 Why Not UIKit?
- Some features are simple to do in SwiftUI while it takes a hundreds of lines of code for doing the same in UIkit
- AutoLayout is extremely difficult to master

## 2.2 Core Data
- Apple's framework for storing application data
- It's used to manipulate data fetched from APIs
- It has integration with iCLoud
- Core Data is not pleasant to work with
- Like UIKit, Core Data is extremely popular


## 2.3 Testing
- Testing make sure our code continuously works correctly after we made significant changes to our codebase
 - Most iOS devs are bad at testing 
 - It's not much fun to write tests 

## 2.4 Software Architecture
- We need to learn to write that is easier to read, easier to write and easier to modify
- SOftware Architecture is not objective

## 2.5 Multithreading 
- Practice of making the code do more than one thing at a time
- Multithreading can be a real headache to work with
- Learn just enough multithreading 

## 3. Common Mistakes 

## 3.1 Trying to memorize everything
- Don't try to memorize anything
- Learn where to lookup things
- We will automatically remember things if we do them enough times
## 3.2 Shiny object syndrome
- When we hit a roadblock, ask for help instead of jumping courses
## 3.3 Lone Wolf Learning
- Share what we are leaning
- If we try to figure things on our own when we get stuck, it would take 5X longer
## 3.4 Using beta software
- We get into a lof of problems when using beta software
- Apple's beta frameworks takes a lof of time to stabilize
## 3.5 Relying om Apple's documentation\
- Trying to learn from the documentation is like trying to learn a human language from the dictionary
- If we have experience with other programming languages, reading Apple's documentation may help
- If we are a beginner, don't start with the documentation  
## 3.6 Getting lost in Objective C
- Objective C has a steep learning curve
- Swift and Objective C has nothing in common
- Almost all the newer codebases are in Swift
## 3.7 Taking Shorts at other languages
- Swift takes inspiration from many other languages

## 4. Learning Resources
- Apple's SwiftUI tutorial teaches us how to create real apps(not teaches Swift)
- Apple's teaching code site
- Apple has a guide for the Swift programming language
- 100 days of SwiftUI
- 100 days of Swift
- Chris King's Youtube tutorial
- Mark Moeykens tutorials
- blckbirds.com swift UI tutorials
- raywenderlich.com 
- donywals.com
- avanderlee.com
- Apple's SwiftUI playground app

## 5. Connecting to the community

### 5.1 Twitter
- Sean Allen
- Antoine v.d SwiftLee
- Novall Swift
- Steve Troughton-Smith
- Kaya Thomas
- Majid Jabrayilov
- Donny Wals
- Sommer Panage
- Natascha Fadeeva 
- Paul Hudson

### 5.2 Newsletter 
- iOS Dev Weekly

### 5.3 Forums
- Hacking With Swift Forum 

## 6. How long it will take to reach my goals
- Don't rush through courses or tutorials
- If we don't have any CS degree or bootcamp experience, it would take around 9 to 12 months to get an iOS job
- Even if we miss schedules, be resilient
