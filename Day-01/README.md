# Day 01 of 100 Days of SwiftUI - Variables, Constants, Strings and Numbers

## Why Swift ?
- Started in 2014 
- Normally only one way to solve each kind of problem
- Makes very very hard to write unsafe code
- Makes it very easy to write code thats clear and understandable

## About this course
- This course does not strive to teach everything about Swift
- It spends more time on subset of features that matters the most
- If we see a particular topic only once, it wont stay in our memory. So repetition is intentional

## How to follow along
- Type the code into your Mac
- Install Xcode and open
- Create a blank project using the MacOS playground(not iOS)
